                Research shows that soaking in a hot tub can significantly
                reduce stress and relaxation.{" "}
              </p>
              <p>
                According to the National Swimming Pool Foundation, "with 25
                minutes of soaking in a 102-degree hot tub, the autonomic
                nervous system alters during warm water immersion, producing
                changes that are parallel to those seen during relaxation and
                accompanying a reduction in anxiety."{" "}

              <p>Promoting deeper relaxation:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The combination of hot water and massage jets reduces muscle
                  tension and eases physical stress.{" "}
                </li>
                <li>The hot water increases body temperature.</li>
                <li>
                  The temperature of the water causes blood vessels to dilate,
                  increases circulation, and lowers blood pressure.

                Among the benefits of soaking in a hot tub is relief from
                chronic pain, which is a growing health problem. According to
                the Centers for Disease Control, 50 million American adults
                suffer from chronic pain, and it is "one of the most common
                reasons adults seek medical care."
              </p>
              <p>
                Treatment for chronic pain can often be focused on managing
                symptoms and improving quality of life. A hot tub can complement
                traditional therapies to improve pain from chronic conditions,
                such as arthritis and sciatica.{" "}
              </p>
              <p>
                Hot water can reduce inflammation and increase blood flow to the
                muscles. In addition, the water temperature can prevent painful
                muscle contractions. The joints will also feel less pressure,
                thanks to water's buoyancy.{" "}
              </p>
              <p>
                But hydrotherapy is more than water and temperature. The
                adjustable massage jets target the muscles and release built-up
                tension so you can realize the benefits of a hot tub.
              </p>
              <p>
                The therapy of a hot tub can benefit people with these
                conditions:

                The temperature and buoyancy of the water can help you improve
                strength and flexibility. Stretching and exercise in a hot tub
                can also better mobility without the risk of injury. Athletes
                who are rehabilitating a sports injury can realize the benefits
                of a hot tub, safely moving stiff joints.

                In addition to fostering greater relaxation, one amazing benefit
                to using a hot tub is getting a better night's rest.{" "}
              </p>
              <p>
                According to the American Psychological Association, "even
                slight sleep deprivation or poor sleep can affect memory,
                judgment and mood." Chronic sleep deprivation can negatively
                affect health, contributing to obesity and high blood pressure.
              </p>
              <p>
                The National Sleep Foundation recommends that adults get seven
                to nine hours of sleep a night. About 35 percent of American
                adults, though, don't get the suggested seven hours and the
                American average is 6.8 hours of sleep a night.

              <p>How can a hot tub help you get better sleep?</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Reduces stress</li>
                <li>Reduces pain</li>
                <li>Changes body temperature</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Soaking in a hot tub in the evening will lead to a body
                temperature change, serving as a sleep aid and a natural
                reminder that it is time for bed. Taking time for yourself in
                the evening, including 20 minutes to unwind in the hot tub, will
                have a positive impact on your sleep.{" "}
